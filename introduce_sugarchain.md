#### English
Sugarchain is a pure POW project, completely driven by the community, and follows the MIT open source agreement. The main goal of the project is an attempt to make a technological breakthrough on the blockchain main chain.

All participants of Sugarchain are volunteers, no pre-mining, no crowdfunding, and no node rewards. The development team (Volunteer Team, Rewarded in Sugar) is only responsible for the technical output and maintenance of the main chain, and is not actively involved in marketing activities.

Sugarchain currently has:
-5 second transaction speed
120 times faster than BTC
30 times faster than LTC
12 times faster than the governor
-Stable trading hours:
For hash attacks, even if the computing power suddenly increases, the block generation time can still be stabilized at 5 seconds.
-Ultra low isolation rate:
According to TestNet results, the average isolation prevention rate is less than 3%.
