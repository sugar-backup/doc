Introduce Sugarchain
--------------------


#### English
Sugarchain is a pure POW project, completely driven by the community, and follows the MIT open source agreement. The main goal of the project is an attempt to make a technological breakthrough on the blockchain main chain.

All participants of Sugarchain are volunteers, no pre-mining, no crowdfunding, and no node rewards. The development team (Volunteer Team, Rewarded in Sugar) is only responsible for the technical output and maintenance of the main chain, and is not actively involved in marketing activities.

Sugarchain currently has:
+ 5 second transaction speed
+ 120 times faster than BTC
+ 30 times faster than LTC
+ 12 times faster than DOGE

Stable transaction time:
For hash attacks, even if the computing power suddenly increases, the block time can still be stabilized at 5 seconds.
Low orphan blocks rate:
According to the testnet results, the average orphan rate is under 3% and no problem occurs.
