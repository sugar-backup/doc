The meaning of Yumekawa
-----------------------

Sugarchain's first node software is called `Yumekawa (夢川)`. It can be translated in some ways.
 - "Yume (夢)" means dream and "Kawa (川)" means river. So its `Dream River` in japanese.
 - The second letter "Kawa" stands for "Kawaii (可愛い)". In this case the meaning is `Dreamy Cute`.
 - Also Yumekawa is replaces the word `Core` (ie: Bitcoin Core). We think it sounds a bit centralized.
